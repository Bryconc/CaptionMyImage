# CaptionMyImage
CaptionMyImage Website designed as a Client Side Web Project where I implement many of the features of a content management system in native HTML, JS, AJAX, and PHP.

**Purpose:** The purpose of the web application is to provide an area where users can come submit there uncaptioned photo, and the community can collectively brainstorm and vote on the funniest caption for the picture.

**Project was developed for CS3440 class, which took place during the Fall 2014 Semester**

**Brief Description:** The purpose of this website is to serve as an open forum for user-generated image captions. Here, users can post their images with which they would like help determining a fitting, witty caption. The uploaded images will be bound to the account they were uploaded with. From this point, others can visit this image and leave their own inspired suggestion for a possible image caption. Finally, as other visitors come to the page, they can either upvote or downvote a comment based on their opinion of it. This will allow the best comment to receive higher scores and stand out more. The only action that requires an account registration is rating; other than that, any submitted action without being logged in will be filed under an “anonymous” account.

**Features:**

Sample Images:
* User Account Registration and Login System
* Image Upload
* Commenting System
* Comment Rating System

**Greatest Achievement:** Without a doubt, I believe my best achievement was my from scratch user-authentication system. I had dabbled in Server Side Programming a little before the class – with the Database class and a little independent study – but I had significant trouble with user-authentication (which I now believe may have been trouble with GoDaddy’s hosting service). I knew that most of the work I did for this project could have been more easily done with a framework, but that’s no fun in my opinion. I really wanted to be able to implement at least a simplistic version of user-authentication on my own, and I believe I was able to do this through this project.

**Final Note:** It should be noted that when I designed the website, I had in mind the small environment of a classroom project. There are a couple things that would need to change if this website were to experience lots of traffic. For example, as of now if more than 45 images are uploaded, than it becomes impossible to find the earliest images through this interface alone; for this, the page counter at the bottom would need to be expanded to account for more pages. There are minor things like this that I did not want to go through the trouble of dealing with, due to the much larger dataset I would require to deal with testing and debugging.
